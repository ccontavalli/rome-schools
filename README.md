# Interactive map of Rome pre-schools and daycares

This repository contains a very simple web site showing all pre-schools and daycares in Rome on a map,
and providing very simple filtering.

The filtering allows to dispaly only the pre-schools and daycares within a certain time (by public transport)
from a chosen location.

If you are moving to Rome, or plan to move there, this would allow you, for example:

 * To find all pre-schools or daycares within 10 mins of your new house.
 * To find all pre-schools or daycares within 30 mins from your workplace, to 
   help you pick an area for your house.

The live web site can be found here:

Note that this web site was mostly meant as an example of how to...

 1. Use Google maps APIs from javascript.
 2. Use Google maps APIs from golang.
 3. Glue a few APIs together with minimal effort to build
    an interactive map that is actually useful.


A blog post describing how this works is here:
